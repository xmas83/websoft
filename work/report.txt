•	Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
I knew about Git and some of its functionalities but never used Markdown and Github pages. It was first time that I did use them, and I found them quite helpful and interesting. 
•	Have you ever created websites before?
I did but not much. I think it was a few months ago and I was watching some Youtubes tutorials on how to build a website using JS and react.js. and that made me to follow some other web developers on Youtube to do a lil more web development. I guess web development is what I want to do in the future as a software developer as I believe it is fun and there are still a lot to learn as the web development technologies are always being updated and it’s kind of cool working and learning brand new technologies and not stick with a specific library or framework for years. 
•	Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
During my studies at Kristianstad Uni we didn’t do much web application development except one or two projects using Java, Javafx and SQL. 
What is your TIL for this course section?
Learning more about Gitgub including Gitpages and some git commands such as Git commit, Git status. I also learned about HTML tags including <a> tag and how to link different html files together even when they are not all located in the same folder.
