<h2>S01</h2>
<p>
1) Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
Answer: I knew about Git and some of its functionalities but never used Markdown and Github pages. It was first time that I did use them, and I found them quite helpful and interesting. 
2) Have you ever created websites before?
Answer: I did but not much. I think it was a few months ago and I was watching some Youtubes tutorials on how to build a website using JS and react.js. and that made me to follow some other web developers on Youtube to do a lil more web development. I guess web development is what I want to do in the future as a software developer as I believe it is fun and there are still a lot to learn as the web development technologies are always being updated and it’s kind of cool working and learning brand new technologies and not stick with a specific library or framework for years. 
3) Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development?
Answer: During my studies at Kristianstad Uni we didn’t do much web application development except one or two projects using Java, Javafx and SQL. 
4) What is your TIL for this course section?
Answer: I learned more about Gitgub and its functionalities including Github pages and some git commands such as Git commit, Git status. I also learned about HTML tags including <a> tag and how to link different html files together even when they are not all located in the same folder.

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>1)	Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript? Answer: yes a lil bit through some self-studies but I wish we could have learned some during school works but unfortunately we didnt get much web development practices and assignments using these technologies. 
2)	Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development?
     Answer: HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language which is also known as standard markup language for documents and it is designed to be used in a web browser to display the webpage information and CSS is a language used to style the elements in our HTML files and JavaScript is a very popular programming language to build interactive webpages and it can be used for both front-end and back-end development and many companies including Facebook and Twitter using JS for their web pages. Nowadays though you can also build other things like realtime applications, mobile apps and even games with JavaScript. 
3)	Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts?
Answer: They all interact and communicate together in order to provide a proper response to the user. When a user sends a request (http request) through a web browser, the browser communicate with the server to get a response back accordingly and show it to the user in the form of a web page. The communication including the request and response to and from the server is done under the HTTP protocol. 
4) What is your TIL for this course section? Answer:  I learned more about HTML and CSS as well as JavaScripts and I’m feeling like the more I do web development the more I become interested in the technologies are being used in web development.

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>1)	Do you have any previous experience of client-side JavaScript? Answer: Not much except some Youtube tutorials as self-studies and a school project using Java and SQL and I had to setup the server side during that project. I also worked on an android project and for that project I was responsible for the server side as well. 
2) Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know? Answer: During the past two years and half I,ve used only Java for most of the school projects and rarely used JavaScript: I have a little bit of experience using Python as well and I think JavaScript is very alike to Python syntactically and Python developers can learn the language faster compared to Java developers and vice versa.
 3) Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
Answer: Among the challenges I had while working with the coding exercises, I can mention some of them including; learning fundamental as sometimes it takes time to get a grasp on things like HTML and CSS. The other things like making meaningless pages, pushing wrong codes to the Github but I think overall It was a great experience for me coding in JS and using the web development technologies. I think based on the fact that I rarely used JS for the past two years, the result coming out from these assignments are fairly okay. I’m happy with the result to some extent and I believe that it could have been even better if we had some JS courses during the past two years and half at school. The codes I’ve written might not be 
     4) What is your TIL for this course section? Answer: I had the chance to learn more about JS as well as CSS and HTML and also write better codes and more importantly improve my client side skills and AJAX technology.

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>1)	Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.? Answer: I used node and NPM during some self-studies and also using the same technologies for the final project of this course. 

2)	How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express? Answer: So far so good. I’ve been enjoying using and learning them and I’m looking forward to getting more exercises using these technologies and maybe get a job as a web developer in the near future. 
3) Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan, and did it work? Answer: Frankly, I didn’t have a specific plan, but I spent a good deal of time learning and then using the web development technologies in order to do these assignments. 
 4) What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level? Answer: Grade 5 and I hope I could get it. It wasn’t that difficult but as I call myself more as a backend developer, so, working with CSS and HTML was a lil bit pain in the “neck”. Overall though, I’m very satisfied with the results.  
 5) What is your TIL for this course section? 
Answer: Improved more web development skills I guess and learned more about the server side with node.js and express.

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>1)	How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?
   Answer: I like it so far and I think learning PHP is a must for every web developer or at least understanding it. 
    
2)	Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?
    Answer: a lil bit alike to Java maybe.   
3)	Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
    Answer: I started by having a look at the examples and then started working on functions.php, config.php and search.php files. Then I started to work with phpMyAdmin where I created my database. Then created a table person and inserted persons with their ids, names and age. Then I created the primary key (auto incremented integer). I guess I deserve 4 or 5 for this. 
4)	What is your TIL for this course section?
    Answer: I learned php language a lil bit. I also got to work with phpMyAdmin and refresh my knowledge on MySQL and also MariaDB for the first time.

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>1)	What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?

Answer: I think it depends on what you want to do with that programming language for instance, if you are working on web apps you might need to use JS for your front end and Java for the backend or maybe even PHP or node.js. 
But since you can do both front and back end with JS and also the technologies that work with JS like, React or TypeScript are very popular I guess JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages when it comes to development of web and mobile applications. The frame works like, react native and React are currently one of the most used technologies are being used these days. Java and Python are popular too. Java is popular mostly for enterprise applications and Python for data analyzing, Machin learning and AI.
I assume that, Java, Python and JS will stay popular for the next 5 years and we will see what the future brings us. 

    
2)	What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?
Answer: I am not sure, but I can tell you I’d like to do more web development and with that being said, I assume I will be more involved with JavaScript in the near future until find another hobby. 
    
3)	Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results
    Answer: I guess comparing Java with JavaScript might be a good comparison, and it is kind of obvious that these two programming languages are the most popular ones in the world of web development. The JS showing a steady trend for the past few years with some slight ups and downs as well as Java but with the JS new technologies coming out one after another including brand new frameworks and libraries, I assume JS would start an uptrend in the near future.  
4)	If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?
Answer: I would definitely recommend Python and JavaScript as this two are easy to learn compared to other programming languages like Java and C++ and there are tons of job opportunities out there for JavaScript and Python developers. Both languages can be used for web development as well as mobile apps. Python is mostly popular for its quick prototyping abilities as well as its great libraries for machine learning, deep learning and AI. 

5)	What is your TIL for this course section?
    It was of course more JS and PHP learnings and first time me using Google trend which was kind of cool.

<h2>S07</h2>
<p>1)	Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.
    Answer:  It is basically an open source development platform used to build different type of applications. The following languages can be used with .Net:
C#, visual basic and F#. The .NET framework is also very popular and been around for a very long time. 
    
2)	Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.
    Answer:  from my own experience I guess .Net framework with C# is easier to work with compared to other programming languages including JS especially when it comes to web development and JS is recommended mostly especially to newbies. 
    
3)	Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
    Answer: I expect the grade 4 or 5 however the result might not be outstanding but as it was the first time for me using .net technologies I think I did a good job. 
I downloaded .net and followed the lectures as well as some youtubes for the assignments.  

4)	What is your TIL for this course section?
    Answer: I learned more about .NET and the technologies working with it as well as MVC pattern (Model View Controller).

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>
1)	Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten?
Answer: from my own experience I can mention SQL injection, XSS or cross-site scripting and sensitive data exposure. The XSS is basically when you accept data from the user, and you are displaying it in your web page, and you are not escaping it. For instance let’s say you had taken some data from the user and then you return it to the user in the text area and if the code that actually they typed in has some HTML in it and especially if you’ve used "script" tag and they can actually put code in the script area that might fetch all the cookies using document. Cookies and make a request to another URL (sending your cookies there). And if I view this page which has other content then it could cause the browser to load my cookies and send it to some other site then the other user could then look at that request and put his cookies in his browser and then start browsing the site as me. 
But if you escape the HTML you don’t have to worry about it. 
Injection: for example, the input from a user is //select * from person where name = Hamid or 2 = 2 which causes that every row from the person table in the DB would be returned back and that is not good, and this is called SQL injection. What would happen is that we are taking the input from the user and use that input directly in a query without validating it and the best to resolve that is using parameterized queries so we use? mark and make sure that the value in its entirety is passed into the name. and here is how the query gets executed: 
//select * from person where name = ‘Hamid or 2 = 2’ and then this will check this as a name.


2)	Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.
            Answer: 1- Implementing a secure SDLC framework for software development.2- gain the knowledge and appreciation for OWASP and build skills for threat modeling. 3- capture security requirements of the applications right at the start of the software development lifecycle. 4- implement secure application design and architecture. 5- ensure secure coding practices r input validation, authentication and authorization. 

3)	What is your TIL for this course section?
            Answer: I learned about OWASP and security issues and how to deal with them as well as their importance in software development.
