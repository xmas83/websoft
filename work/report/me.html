<h1>My report page in the course Software Development for the Web</h1>

<p><img src="img/me.jpg" width="700" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is Hamid Alijani, born and raised in Tehran.Iran. I came to Sweden in 2010 as an International student, studied business administration at Dalarna University in Borl√§nge. After graduation moved to Stockholm to find a job and after two years living in STKLM moved to Kristianstad to study computer science and programming.</p>

<p>Ive been always interested in learning programming especially when I met my first friend here in Sweden who was a programmer studying embeded system at Dalarna University. By the time I was studying business, he was studying computer science, then he moved to the US to pursue a PHD in CS. He was the one that pushed me to learn programming.</p>

<p>If I should mention a hobby, besides web programming, then it would be making electronic musics as I studied music in my home town and been producing electronic musics since then but not constantly.</p>



<p>Lets keep in touch in the chatt and through GitHub!</p>
