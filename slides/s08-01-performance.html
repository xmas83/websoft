<script data-role="slide" data-markdown type="text/html">
# Performance in general

* Accuracy, efficiency and speed of executing computer program instructions.

</script>



<script data-role="slide" data-markdown type="text/html">
# Performance factors

* Short response time for a given piece of work.
* High throughput.
* Low utilization of computing resource(s).
* High availability of the computing system or application.
* Fast data compression and decompression.
* High bandwidth.
* Short data transmission time.
 
</script>



<script data-role="slide" data-markdown type="text/html">
# Performance areas

* Computer/Application performance
    * Performance analysis
    * Performance tuning
    * Software performance testing
* Network performance

</script>



<script data-role="slide" data-markdown type="text/html">
# Performance analysis

* In software engineering, profiling is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls. Most commonly, profiling information serves to aid program optimization.

</script>


<script data-role="slide" data-markdown type="text/html">
# Performance tuning

* Performance tuning is the improvement of system performance. Typically in computer systems, the motivation for such activity is called a performance problem, which can be either real or anticipated. Most systems will respond to increased load with some degree of decreasing performance. A system's ability to accept higher load is called scalability, and modifying a system to handle a higher load is synonymous to performance tuning.

</script>


<script data-role="slide" data-markdown type="text/html">
# Performance testing

* In software quality assurance, performance testing is in general a testing practice performed to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage.
